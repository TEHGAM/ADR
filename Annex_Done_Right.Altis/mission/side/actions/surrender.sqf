Description:

	Object is teleported to side mission location
	addAction on object executes this script
	when script is done, spawn explosion and teleport object away
	
	Modified for simplicity and other applications (non-destroy missions).
	BIS_fnc_MP/BIS_fnc_spawn/BIS_fnc_timetostring are all performance hogs.
	
To do:

	Needs re-framing for 'talk to contact' type missions [DONE]
	
	This code is now just a variable switch, to be sent back in order that the mission script can continue.
	
	Does it allow for possibility of failure? I dont know, too tired at the moment.
