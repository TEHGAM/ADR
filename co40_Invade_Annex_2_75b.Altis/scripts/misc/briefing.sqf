"Enforcement",
"
<br />The purpose of the above rules are to ensure a fun and relaxing environment for public players.
<br />
<br />Server rules are in place merely as a means to that end.
<br />
<br />Guideline for enforcement:
<br />
<br />-	Innocent rule violation and disruptive behavior: 
<br />
<br />		= Verbal / Written request to cease, or warning.
<br /> 
<br />-	Minor or first-time rule violation:
<br />
<br />		= Kick, or 0 - 3 day ban.
<br />
<br />-	Serious or repetitive rule violation: 
<br />
<br />		= 3 - 7 day ban.
<br />
<br />-	Administrative ban (hack/exploit/verbal abuse/serious offense):
<br />
<br />		= permanent or 30 day.
<br />
<br />
<br />The above is subject to discretion.

<br /> Pilots are deemed to be mission-critical roles, and as such have extra responsibility to ensure smooth, fun and realistic gameplay for others.
<br />
<br />1. You MUST be on our Teamspeak server--in the correct channel--and communicable. Exception if TS is down or full.
<br />
<br />2. CAS assets (all fixed wing and forward-armed rotary-wing) are under the command of ground Squad/Team Leaders, JTAC, moderators, and admins.
<br />
<br />-		a. CAS must receive permission from ground to engage targets, with two exceptions: Air threats and ZSU-39 Tigris.
<br />-		b. If you engage targets without permission, you may be asked to leave the Pilot role, or expelled from the server.
<br />
<br />3. If you are an inexperienced pilot, please consider the time and enjoyment of others.
<br /> 
<br />4. This is a public server. Helicopters are not private/reserved transport. A Pilots primary role is to provide timely general transport to and from objectives.
<br /> 
<br />-		a. A group can have a dedicated pilot, but a pilot may not be dedicated to one group.
<br />-		* General transport in this context is defined as: Indiscriminate and timely transport for each and all players on the server.
<br />
<br />5. MH-9s are only to be used by non-Pilots if there are less than 20 players (approx) in-game.
<br />
<br />-		a. Use of the MH-9s by non-Pilots is subject to the orders of any in-game Pilots, moderators, and Administrators.
<br />
<br />The above rules are subject to discretion of moderators and administrators.
<br />
<br />If you see a player in violation of the above, contact a moderator or admin (teamspeak).

<br />1. Hacking and mission exploitation will not be tolerated.
<br />2. Intentional team-killing will not be tolerated.
<br />3. Excessive, unintentional team-killing may result in a Kick/Temp ban.
<br />4. Unnecessary destruction of BLUFOR vehicles will not be tolerated.
<br />5. Verbal abuse and bullying will not be tolerated. 
<br />6. Firing a weapon on base--unless at an enemy--may result in a Kick/Temp ban.
<br />7. Griefing and obstructive play will not be tolerated.
<br />8. Excessive mic spamming, especially of Side and Global channels, will not be tolerated.
<br />9. A server moderator or admin's word is final.
<br />
<br />If you see a player in violation of the above, contact a moderator or admin (teamspeak).

"UAVs",
"
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> Can I use the UAVs?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> Yes, however you must be in the UAV Operator role and you must have a UAV Terminal.
<br />
<br />
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> Why do the UAVs keep exploding?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> When the bomb-equipped UAVs are first connected to, the Gunner AI fires its weapons. Until it's fixed, here is a guide for you.<br />
<br /> To safely connect to the MQ4A Greyhawk UAV:<br />
<br />	1. Enter action menu (mouse scroll), click 'Open UAV Terminal'.
<br />	2. Right-click on the UAV you wish to control, on the terminal map.
<br />	3. Click 'Connect Terminal to UAV'.
<br /><br /> [IMPORTANT] Do NOT click 'Take Control' button in UAV Terminal.<br />
<br />	4. Esc out of the UAV terminal.
<br />	5. Enter action menu (mouse scroll) again.
<br />	6. [IMPORTANT] Select 'Take UAV TURRET controls'.<br />
<br />
<br />	It is now safe to 'Take Control' of the UAV.
<br />
<br />
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> Why can't I connect to the UAV?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> Sometimes the UAVs are still connected to the prior Operators Terminal. If he disconnects or dies, sometimes the Terminal does not delete properly. The only solution at this time is to destroy the UAV, and you yourself must respawn.

<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> How do I join a squad?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font>

<br /> 2. While holding T, use your scroll wheel to interact.
<br /> 3. You can interact with the person you are looking at, or those within a 5m radius.
<br />
<br /> * Xeno's Squad Management tool had to be removed at request of the script author.

"FOBs",
"
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> How do I get to a FOB?<br />

"Bipod",
"
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> How do I deploy bipod?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> Open the Mods tab and look for VTS weaponresting. 
<br /> 1. Download and follow the instructions.
<br /> 2. Use when you are in a stable firing position.
<br /> 3. Default keys: Ctrl + Spacebar
<br />
<br /> ArmA 3 does not have integrated bipod function, so we have to use community-created mods to simulate.
