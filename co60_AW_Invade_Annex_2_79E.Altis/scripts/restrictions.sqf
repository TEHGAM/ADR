Quiksilver notes:

	The more restrictions, the more performance-costly, as it is monitoring constantly whether players have weapons they shouldn't have.
	Item restrictions (explosives, rangefinders, uav terminals, etc.) have to be considered in a different manner. As of ArmA 1.16, don't bother trying to restrict
	items using the below setup, it doesn't work.
