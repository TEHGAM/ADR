"UAVs",
"
<br /> In the Control Tower at base, a UAV Operator can now recycle the UAV crew on one of the computer terminals.
<br /><br />
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> Can I use the UAVs?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> Yes, however you must be in the UAV Operator role and you must have a UAV Terminal.
<br />
<br />
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> Why do the UAVs keep exploding?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> When the bomb-equipped UAVs are first connected to, the Gunner AI fires its weapons. Until it's fixed, here is a guide for you.<br />
<br /> To safely connect to the MQ4A Greyhawk UAV:<br />
<br />	1. Enter action menu (mouse scroll), click 'Open UAV Terminal'.
<br />	2. Right-click on the UAV you wish to control, on the terminal map.
<br />	3. Click 'Connect Terminal to UAV'.
<br /><br /> [IMPORTANT] Do NOT click 'Take Control' button in UAV Terminal.<br />
<br />	4. Esc out of the UAV terminal.
<br />	5. Enter action menu (mouse scroll) again.
<br />	6. [IMPORTANT] Select 'Take UAV TURRET controls'.<br />
<br />
<br />	It is now safe to 'Take Control' of the UAV.
<br />
<br />
<br /><font size='16'>Q:</font> Why can't I connect to the UAV?<br />
<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> Sometimes the UAVs are still connected to the prior Operators Terminal. If he disconnects or dies, sometimes the Terminal does not delete properly. The only solution at this time is to destroy the UAV, and you yourself must respawn.

<br /> 1. Hold 'T'.
<br /> 2. While holding T, use your scroll wheel to interact.
<br /> 3. You can interact with the person you are looking at, or those within a 5m radius.
<br />
<br /> * Xeno's Squad Management tool had to be removed at request of the script author.

player createDiaryRecord ["faq",
[
"Bipod",
"

<br /><font size='16'>A:</font> Open the Mods tab and look for VTS weaponresting. 
<br /> 1. Download and follow the instructions.
<br /> 2. Use when you are in a stable firing position.
<br /> 3. Default keys: Ctrl + Spacebar
<br />
<br /> ArmA 3 does not have integrated bipod function, so we have to use community-created mods to simulate.
